Engineering-Tools
=================

An open source collection of cool programs, made by cooler people. I.e. perhaps useful shit.

This repository is meant to be a database of programs that we come up with, whether they are actually useful projects, or some random implementations of a neat abstract idea, your genius breakthroughs belong here. In the future, we can take a look back, and maybe even reference some of our programs here. Be sure to properly label yourself and your code. Enjoy!
